    <h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

<p>This recipe makes a quick and tasty, no mess hummus. It has been adapted from several different recipes I've read over the years.</p>

<p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste that is widely used in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meat and pitta bread..</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>1 can (400g) chickpeas (garbanzo beans)</li>
<li>175g tahini</li>
<li>6 sun-dried tomatoes</li>
<li>Half a red bell pepper</li>
<li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
<li>1 clove garlic</li>
<li>A pinch of olive oil</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Peel the garlic and chop it coarsely.</li>
  <li>
    Remove the seeds and stem from the bell pepper, and cut it into thick pieces.
  </li>
  <li>Put all foods in a food processor.</li>
  <li>
    Process all ingredients to a paste.
    <ul>
      <li>If you want a "thick" hummus, process it for a short time.</li>
      <li>Chop longer if a "smooth" hummus is desired.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>For a different flavor, you can try mixing a small measure of lemon and cilantro, chili, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Taste it and confirm that it is just right.</p>

<h2>Storage</h2>

<p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after making it. If it starts to bubble, you should definitely discard it.</p>

<p>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>
